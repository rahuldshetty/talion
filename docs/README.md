> Dynamically-typed interpreter programming language written in Go. This project is based out of a  book called [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com) which is about building your own programming language. I have followed this book for majority of the portion while writing talion language but with extension to some cool C & JavaScript constucts to make talion developer friendly language.

## Features 

- Easy to Code
- High Level interpreter language
- Dynamically-Typed 
- Dynamic memory allocation & Garbage collector using Go's GC system.
- Free & Open Source
