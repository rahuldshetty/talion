# What Next ?

talion is a programming language that is built for educational purpose. Feel free to pull the code & play around with it to make your own programming language syntax.

I will be continuing to work on this project to implement some of the core functionalties to make talion great. Some of the things that I have in mind for the future releases:

- For Loop (Important!!)
- REPL:
    - Parsing newline characters for multi-line statements.
    - Rich help interface for binary execution & support to read/evaluate code from file.
- Additional Data Types:
    - Floating-point numeric data type
    - Character
- Sting Data Type
    - Add support for escape character parsing.
    - Comarison operator
- File Object Support
- More Builtin methods & standardize math libraries.
