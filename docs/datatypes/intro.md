# Data Types

Data Types define what values the programming language can interpret and what actions that can be performed on that value. For talion, we have two main classes of data type. First one being the primitie data type that are mentioned below:
 
talion currently supports following primitive data types:
- [Integer](/datatypes/integer.md)
- [Boolean](/datatypes/boolean.md)
- [String](/datatypes/string.md)

talion also offers derived datatypes:
- [List](/datatypes/list.md)
- [Hash](/datatypes/hash.md)
